## What's special about this Mine Sweeper?

It was made using my own library to make canvas interactions easier! You can check it out [@wCanvas's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hds536jhmk/wCanvas).

## What are the keys to play this?

The keybindings are the following:

 * **R** : Starts a new game.
 * **Click** : Shows the clicked cell.
 * **Shift + Click** : Marks the clicked cell as a Bomb.

## Does this work on phones?

This project doesn't currently work on phones, tho it will probably support them in the near future.
